## Introduction

In this document we describe the development of traffic light detection model. We developed separate models for simulator and real images. The first version of both models was used in the on-site test. When analyzing test recordings we found that the model for real images had significant accuracy and detection issues. We addressed these issues in the second version of this model. 

## Environment Setup

We developed traffic light detection model using Object Detection API of Tensorflow. This model is deployed in [self-driving car](https://medium.com/udacity/how-the-udacity-self-driving-car-works-575365270a40) of Udacity, that has version 1.3 of Tensorflow and Titan X GPU. Hence, to prevent any potential incompatibility issues, we developed the model using the same version of Tensorflow. 

We used GPU-enabled version of Tensorflow to speed model training and to generate a GPU-aware model. To train the model, we used [NC6 virtual machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-gpu) in Azure cloud. This machine has K80 GPU of NVIDIA. Even with such powerful GPU, training the model took several hours.

Object Detection API doesn't have the same versioning system as Tensorflow. Therefore, in order to prevent conflicts between Tensorflow and Object Detection API,  we had to determine the last commit to Object Detection API that is compatible with version 1.3 of Tensorflow. According to [Releases](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases?after=v1.4.0-rc1) section of Tensorflow repository, Version 1.3 of Tensorflow was released at 8/16/2017, the next version, 1.3.1, was released at 9/26/2017. According to [this](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/commits/master?after=86ac7a47f03c08112a93b1a18be8e23b8989c4e9+174&path%5B%5D=research&path%5B%5D=object_detection) page, the last commit to Object Detection API before 9/26/2017 was 4a705e08ca8f28bd05bdc2287211ad8aba0bf98a and it was done at 9/22/2017. Hence we cloned the repository of Objecty Detection API and checked out this commit:

    git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models
    cd models
    git checkout 4a705e08ca8f28bd05bdc2287211ad8aba0bf98a   

As part of installing Object Detection API, we added the following line to `~/.bashrc` file:

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<local direcotry of models repo>/models/research:<local directory of models repo>/models/research/slim

## Datasets

We used the following datasets to develop the first version of the model:
* Dataset 1: the [dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vaniv8eqna89r20/alex-lechner-udacity-traffic-light-dataset.zip?dl=0) created by [Alex Lechner](https://github.com/alex-lechner). This dataset has 917 images from simulator and 155 images from the test track.
* Dataset 2: the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Eiyn-CUQtxdUZWMkFfQzdObUE/view?usp=sharing) created by [Vatsal Srivastava](https://github.com/coldKnight). This dataset has 277 images from simulator and 159 images from the test track.
* Dataset 3: our own dataset of images extracted from ROS bag file provided by Udacity. This dataset has 297 images from the test track and is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ii4ddadp7lih7b4/dataset_ros.zip?dl=0).  

In all these datasets each image has at least one visible traffic light.  

In the second version of the model we used 2 ROS bag files from on-site test to create 4 additional datasets:
* Dataset 4: dataset of 46 images extracted from the first ROS bag file from on-site test. Each image in this dataset has a visible traffic light. 
* Dataset 5: dataset of 58 images extracted from the second ROS bag file from on-site test. Each image in this dataset has a visible traffic light. 
* Dataset 6: dataset of 53 images extracted from the first ROS bag file from on-site test. Each image in this dataset does not have any visible traffic light. 
* Dataset 7: dataset of 62 images extracted from the second ROS bag file from on-site test. Each image in this dataset does not have any visible traffic light. 

Datasets 4 and 6 are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jda6cjdg3hbqwiu/bag1.zip?dl=0), datasets 5 and 7 are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mctg7sobxo2g118/bag2.zip?dl=0).

The following table summarizes ROS bag files used to develop the models:

| ID  | Description | Used to train V1 model | Used to train V2 model | Number of images | Used in datasets | URL |

Each image with traffic lights has one or more annotation rectangles, indicating locations and colors of traffic light. Annotations are stored separately and are not part of images. Here are examples of simulator images with annotations drawn on top of them:

![alt text][image2]

![alt text][image3]

Similarly, here are examples of real images, with annotations drawn on top of them:

![alt text][image4]

![alt text][image5]

![alt text][image6]

Object Detection API expects the dataset to be in a single-binary-file TFRecord format. Fortunately, the first two datasets have already TFRecord files, one for simulated and one for real images. In the next section we show how we generated other datasets.

### Generation of dataset from a ROS bag file

We used `rosbag` and `image_view` tools of ROS to extract images from ROS bag files. ROS bag files can be replayed using `rosbag` tool of ROS.  `image_view` utility of ROS allows to save images published in a given topic. We created a launch script, called `export.launch` that runs `rosbag` and `image_view`:

    <launch>
        <node pkg="rosbag" type="play" name="rosbag" args="<full path to ROS bag file>" />
        <node name="extract" pkg="image_view" type="image_saver" respawn="false" output="screen" cwd="ROS_HOME">
        <remap from="image" to="image_raw" />
        </node>
    </launch>

The parameter args in the second line of launch should have a full path to ROS bag file. `export.launch` script is stored in `ros\launch` directory. To extract the images from ROS bag file we just need to run

    roslaunch export.launch

The images are extracted to ~/.ros directory. Altogether, we extracted 2030, 985 and 1193 JPEG images from the first, second and third ROS bag files respectively. In the next two sections we describe how to generate TFRecord datasets of images with and without annotations.

#### Generation of dataset with annotated images

We used [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) utility to annotate images that have a visible traffic light. This program creates XML files with annotations. We saved all annotation in `labels` directory that is placed in the directory of images. Then we used our own `create_real_camera_tf_record.py` utility to convert annotated images to a single TFRecord file:

    python create_real_camera_tf_record.py --data_dir=<path to the directory of images> --annotations_dir=labels --output_path=<path to the output file> --label_map_path=../label_mapping_lowercase.pbtxt 

`create_real_camera_tf_record.py` is a simplified version of `create_pascal_tf_record.py` utility of Object Detection API and is stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training` directory.  

`create_real_camera_tf_record.py` has a number of parameters. `data_dir` should point to the directory of images, `annotations_dir` should be a name of directory with XML files. Notice that due to limitations of `create_real_camera_tf_record.py`, `annotations_dir` should be a directory within `data_dir`. `output_path` is a path to the output TFRecord file. Finally, `label_map_path` is a path to the file that maps categorical labels in annotations files to numberic labels that will be used by Tensorflow. We used the following mapping:

    item {
        id: 1
        name: 'green'
    }
    item {
        id: 2
        name: 'red'
    }
    item {
        id: 3
        name: 'yellow'
    }

This mapping is consistent with the mappping in two other datasets mentioned above. The mapping data stored in `label_mapping_lowercase.pbtxt` file in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training` directory. 

#### Generation of dataset without annotations

We modified `create_real_camera_tf_record.py` script to create TFRecord dataset with images without annotations. In all images in this dataset there is no visible traffic light and the lists of bounding boxes and labels are empty. The modified script is called `create_real_camera_tf_record_no_annotations.py` and is stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training` directory. This script has the same parameters as `create_real_camera_tf_record.py`. Currently the identifiers of images without traffic light are hard-coded in `create_real_camera_tf_record_no_annotations.py`, but we plan to change this in the future.

## Training

Traffic light detection module get a new image with the frequency of 15Hz. Hence, to process images in real-time, the traffic light detection model should score a new image within 1/15 seconds = 66 milliseconds. 
Our model is based on pre-trained SSD-MobileNet-V1-COCO model that is available [here](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz). In particular our network has the same architecture as SSD-MobileNet, except the final prediction layer. Also, the weights in all layers, except the final one, were initialized with the corresponding values in SSD-MobileNet-V1-COCO. We chose SSD-MobileNet-V1-COCO because it was the only model with real-time inference that is compatible with version 1.3.0 of Tensorflow. The zipped model has 3 checkpoint files (with ckpt extension). We placed these files in a separate `models` directory. We also copied configuration file of the model, `<path to Object Detection API>/models/research/object_detection/samples/configs/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config`, to the current directory. 

### Environment setup - first version of the models

The training process assumes that training and test sets, as well as the label mapping file are stored in `data` directory. We did a number of changes in model configuration file to specify the locations of dataset, checkpoint and label mapping files. The line 

    fine_tune_checkpoint: "PATH_TO_BE_CONFIGURED/model.ckpt"

was replaced with 

     fine_tune_checkpoint: "models/model.ckpt"
Next, the line 

    input_path: "PATH_TO_BE_CONFIGURED/mscoco_train.record"
in the input_reader section of config file was replaced with

    input_path: "data/<dataset name>.record"
Finally, the line

    label_map_path: "PATH_TO_BE_CONFIGURED/mscoco_label_map.pbtxt"
in the input_reader section of config file was replaced with 

    label_map_path: "data/label_mapping_lowercase.pbtxt"
We didn't use evaluation functionality of Object Detection API and hence we didn't change eval_config and eval_input_reader sections of config file.

Since the original model was trained with 90 classes and in our dataset we have only 3 classes of objects (green, yellow and red), we changed the architecture of the final prediction layer by replacing the line  

     num_classes: 90   
in model configuration file with  

     num_classes: 3

Finally, we changed the maximal number of epochs from 200000 to 20000 by replacing 

    num_steps: 200000
with

    num_steps: 20000

We would like to save the model after each epoch and at the end of the training process choose the one with the lowest training loss value. Unfortunately, Object Detection API can save a model only in fixed time intervals. We saved the model every 0.3 seconds. This resulted in saving the model after approximately every second epoch. We tried to reduce the time saving interval from 0.3 seconds to smaller values, but this also resulted in saving the model after approximately every second epoch. 

At the end of the training process we had about 10000 models and chose the one with the lowest training loss.  

To save the model every 0.3 seconds and to keep the last saved 20000 models, we modified `models/research/object_detection/trainer.py` in two places:  
* we added a parameter max_to_keep=20000 when initializing tf.train.Saver (line 281 in `trainer.py`)  
* we added parameters save_summaries_secs=0.3 and save_interval_secs=0.3 when calling slim.learning.train (line 284 in `trainer.py`).

The training process is managed by `train.py` file provided by Object Detection API in `models/research/object_detection` folder. We launched the training process using the following command:

    nohup python <path to Object Detection API>/models/research/object_detection/train.py --train_dir=./models/train --pipeline_config_path=<model config file> >& out.txt &

The training takes around 7 hours. `nohup` and the trailing `&` are needed for running the training in the background and uninterrupted running when we log out of virtual machine.  

When we ran the training for the first time, it failed with the error

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "train.py", line 200, in <module>
      tf.app.run()

    name='filenames')
    ...
    TypeError: Expected string, got ['data/images_ros_all.record'] of type 'RepeatedScalarContainer' instead.

This is a [known issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/2757) of Object Detection API that was fixed in later commits. In our case we fixed it by changing line 53 in
`models/research/object_detection/builders/input_reader_builder.py` file from

     config.input_path,

to

     config.input_path[:],

The modified `trainer.py` and `input_builder.py` files are stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/changed_tensorflow_files` folder.

### Environment setup - second version of the model for real images

Object Detection API uses as a training loss an average of localization and classification errors. While this loss function is convenient for training the model, it is less useful for evaluation of the traffic light detection performance. We define **traffic light error** as the sum of *traffic light detection error* and *traffic light classification error*.

*Traffic light detection error* is the number of images that satisfy either of these two conditions:

* there was no visible light, but the model detected a bounding box with a yellow or red light light.  
* there is a visible light with yellow or green color, but the model did not detect it

Notice that when there is no visible light but the model detected a green light, the car continues to drive as usual and we do not count this case as a wrong detection. Similarly, when there is a visible green light and the model didn't detect a traffic light, the car continues to drive as usual and there is no error. 

*Traffic light classification error* is the number of images where there is a visible traffic light, the model detected it, but classified with the wrong color.

We would like to obtain a model with the smallest traffic light error, measured over validation set. This can be achieved by running Object Detection API evaluation script `eval.py` sequentially over the models created by the training process that is managed by `train.py`. Unfortunately `eval.py` does not support custom metrics. Moreover, `eval.py` evaluates the latest available model and cannot process models sequentially. Hence we had to customize the evaluation process of Object Detection API to obtain the desired model. We start with the description of changes in configuration files. 

We changed `eval_config` and `eval_input_reader` parts of the configuration file to 

    eval_config: {
        num_examples: <number of examples in validation set>
        eval_interval_secs: 0
        metrics_set: "traffic_light_metrics"
    }

    eval_input_reader: {
        tf_record_input_reader {
            input_path: "data/<validation set name>.record"
        }
        label_map_path: "data/label_mapping_lowercase.pbtxt"
        shuffle: false
        num_readers: 1
        num_epochs: 1
    }

The validation set used in this evaluation should have images with a single green/red/yellow label if there is a traffic light and with no labels if there are no traffic lights. In the next section we show how to create such dataset.

We set metrics_set parameter to custom metric "traffic_light_metrics". This is the traffic light error described above and later on we will describe its implementation. We also set eval_interval_secs parameter to 0 to eliminate any delay between successive runs of evaluation code. 

We have implemented the computation of traffic light error in `evaluate_traffic_light_detection` function in `models/research/object_detection/eval_util.py` file of Object Detection API. We also modified `run_checkpoint_once` and `repeated_checkpoint_run` functions in that file to evaluate the models sequentially. Finally, we changed the logging settings to store the results of evaluation in standard output.

We also did a number of changes in `models/research/object_detection/evaluator.py` file:   
* added a definition of traffic light detection metric in EVAL_METRICS_FN dictionary
* removed functionality of saving sample evaluated images, in order to speed up the evaluation process
* fixed a bug in _process_aggregated_results function to properly parse the metric name that was specified in configuration file
* rewrote _restore_latest_checkpoint function to restore the earliest checkpoint that was not restored previously.

In general, running evaluation process over 10000 models generated during the training phase takes many days. To speed up this process, we evaluated every fourth model generated during the training. This functionality of skipping 3 models is implemented in _restore_latest_checkpoint function in `evaluator.py`.

The modified `evaluator.py` and `eval_util.py` files are stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/changed_tensorflow_files` folder.

The evaluation process is managed by `eval.py` file provided by Object Detection API in `models/research/object_detection` folder. We launched the evaluation process using the following command:

    nohup python <path to Object Detection API>/models/research/object_detection/eval.py  --logtostderr --checkpoint_dir=./models/train --eval_dir=./eval --pipeline_config_path=<model config file> >& out_eval.txt &

Since we had limited GPU resources, we rane evaluation process after the training process has finished. The evaluation process took about 24 hours.

### Training model for simulator images
We used simulator images of Dataset 1 as a training and evaluation set. Simulator images from Dataset 2 were a test set. The configuration file for training this model is stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config_sim` file. The model with the smallest loss was obtained after epoch 15339 and had a loss 0.6341 . We also stored the training log file in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/training_logs/log_sim.txt`.

### Training models for real images

#### First version

We concatenated real images from all 3 datasets into a single training set. This training set has a total of 611 images and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s28zz6ia9kafesw/images_ros_all.record?dl=0). The configuration file for training this model is stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config_real` file. The model with the smallest loss was obtained after epoch 6651 and had a loss 0.4667. We stored the training log file in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/training_logs/log_real.txt`.

#### Second version

We concatenated real images from all 7 datasets into a single training set. This training set has a total of 830 images and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/coycrqxbr4zo50y/images_ros_all_bags.record?dl=0). 

We also created a validation set from the images extracted from second and third ROS bag files. To speed up the evaluation process, we sampled 10% of the images from these files. The sampled validation images do not overlap with the training images used in datasets 4-7. We extracted and converted images to TFRecord format using `create_real_camera_tf_record_image_label.py` script. This script attaches a single label to an image if it contains a visible traffic, otherwise an image has an empty label. Also, all output images have an empty list of bounding boxes. Currently the true labels of the images are hard-coded in `create_real_camera_tf_record_image_label.py`, but we plan to change this in the future. `create_real_camera_tf_record_image_label.py` has the same parameters as `create_real_camera_tf_record.py` script and is stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training` folder. The validation set has a total of 217 images and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sq0atdzgkh2kvlo/bag12_small.record?dl=0).

The configuration file for training this model is stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config_real_v2` file. The model with the smallest traffic light loss was obtained after epoch 10636. This model had 0 traffic light validation error and a training loss of 2.2583. We stored training and evaluation log files in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/training_logs/log_real_v2.txt` and `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/training_logs/log_real_eval_v2.txt` respectively.

Notice that this training loss is much larger than the one obtained in the first version of the model. That's because the first  version of the model was selected to minimize the training loss whereas the second version of the model was chosen to minimize validation error. 

## Exporting the model

After training a model we exported it using the command

    python <path to Object Detection API>/models/research/object_detection/export_inference_graph.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path ./ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config --trained_checkpoint_prefix ./models/train/model.ckpt-<best epoch number> --output_directory ./fine_tuned_model

This command creates a `fine_tuned_model/frozen_inference_graph.pb` file. We renamed this file to either `sim_model.pb` or `real_model.pb`, depending on the type of the model, and copied it to `ros/src/tl_detector/light_classification` folder.

## Evaluation

In the evaluation process we considered only the detected bounding box with the highest score. If this score is at least 0.1 then we defined that the model detected a light in the image, otherwise we define that the model does not detect any light. The same logic is used by traffic light detector module when applying the model in real-time. 

### Model for simulator images 

We evaluated the model over random 5 images from the training set and random 10 images from the test set. These images are stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/test_images` folder. The evaluation  is done in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/object_detection_evaluation_sim.ipynb` notebook. The model has perfect detections in 14 out of 15 images. Here are sample images with perfect detections:

![alt text][image7]

![alt text][image8]

![alt text][image9]

In a single problematic image all lights are very small:

![alt text][image10]

But nevertheless in this image the detection with the highest score is correct (red light) and this is sufficient for practical purposes.  

### Model for real images

#### First version

We evaluated the model over all 2030 images extracted from the first ROS bag file. 297 of these images are also in the training set. The evaluation is done in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training/object_detection_evaluation_real.ipynb` notebook. 

For the purpose of evaluation, we labelled manually all images with the labels 'green', 'yellow', 'red', 'no light'. Unlike training labels, these are categorical labels and not bounding boxes. During evaluation we computed detection error and classification error.  

Our model has 11 images with detection error and 8 images with classification error. Overall the model generated correct detections in 2011/2030*100%=99% of the images. Here are sample images with correct predictions: 

![alt text][image11]

![alt text][image12]

![alt text][image13]

After obtaining the second and the third ROS bag files, we tested the model over them. Unfortunately the model had a very bad performance over these files. The following table summarizes evaluation of the model over three ROS bag files:

| ROS bag file | Detection Error | Classification Error | Traffic Light Error |
|:------------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 1            |     11          |         8            |          19        |
| 2            |     192          |         194           |        386        |
| 3            |     364         |         174            |        538         |

The evaluation over second and third ROS bag files is done in `object_detection_evaluation_real_bag1.ipynb` and `object_detection_evaluation_real_bag2.ipynb` notebooks stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training` folder.

The main reason for a bad performance in the second and third ROS files is that images in these files have different colors in traffic lights and trees than the ones in the first file. This might be attributed to different light conditions when recording ROS bag files. Here are examples of traffic lights from the second ROS bag file:

Additional reason for a bad performance is that the model overfits to the images in the first ROS bag file by optimizing the average of training localization and classification losses. As we mentioned in the Section 4.2, these losses are less useful for evaluation of traffil light detection performance.

#### Second version

The following table summarizes evaluation of the second version of the model over three ROS bag files:

| ROS bag file | Detection Error | Classification Error | Traffic Light Error |
|:------------:|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 1            |     4           |         11           |          15         |
| 2            |     2           |         1            |          3          |
| 3            |     19          |         1            |          20         |

In the second and third ROS bag files the second version of the model improved performance dramatically over the one of the first version of the model. In the first ROS bag file the performance of both models is about the same.

The evaluation notebooks of the second version of the model for the first, second and third ROS bag files are `object_detection_evaluation_real_V2.ipynb`, `object_detection_evaluation_real_bag1_V2.ipynb` and `object_detection_evaluation_real_bag2_V2.ipynb` respectively, and are stored in `ros/src/tl_detector/model_training` folder.
